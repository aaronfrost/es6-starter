# es6-starter
This is a simple starter project that shows how to use WebPack and 6to5 to get a proper ES6 project in the web. 

- Install Webpack
- Run `npm install` on the project
- Run `webpack -w` to watch for changes in your app.js.
- Server your public directory (ie: perhaps `http-server` or some other simple static server)
- Load index.html in browser
- (Optional) Get Live reload going so that as webpack re-compiles ES6toES5, it will auto load the new stuff in your browser
